Whack-a-Mole Game

This is a simple browser-based Whack-a-Mole game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to quickly click the active mole that appears randomly on the screen. Each successful click increases the score, and the goal is to reach 5 points to win.

The game logic uses JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling to activate moles at random intervals. Only one mole becomes active at a time, changing its color to indicate when it can be clicked. Once the player reaches the winning score, the game stops automatically, displays a congratulatory message, and shows a restart button.
